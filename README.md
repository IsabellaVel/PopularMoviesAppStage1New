# PopularMoviesAppStage2

Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project, where I have implemented Retrofit library to make network calls, also GridView for showing newest or most rated movies from the Movies Database API. 

The aim is to allow the user to choose from 2 modes of viewing the movies - latest or most rated.
The details fragment of each movie shows a trailer, brief info about the movie, and some comments by users of the database.

feel free to do so.
